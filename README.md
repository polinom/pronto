Tools to make PR realeasing and working with jira tasks easier..


# Installation

If you don't use `pipsi`, you're missing out.
Here are [installation instructions](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/pipsi#readme).


Simply run:

    $ pipsi install .

But it's better to do following:

```
    git clone git@github.com:polinom/pronto.git
    cd pronto
    pipsi install -e .
```

In this case you are able to change source code, improve it and push changes to repo.
